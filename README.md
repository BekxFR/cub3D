## Project Overview:

### Summary:

Cub3D is a fascinating project inspired by the iconic game Wolfenstein3D, considered the pioneer of first-person shooters. It offers you the opportunity to explore the intricacies of ray-casting, a fundamental technique in early 3D game development. Your mission? Create a dynamic view within a maze, navigating your way through its corridors and challenges.

### Key Features:

1. Ray-Casting Technique: Embrace the challenge of ray-casting, the cornerstone of early 3D gaming. Use it to render a realistic 3D representation within the confines of a maze, just like the pioneers did.
2. Pathfinding for Map Verification: Implement pathfinding algorithms to ensure the validity of the map. Verify that the maze is enclosed by walls and handle any configuration issues gracefully.
3. 3D Rendering: Dive into the world of pseudo-3D rendering. Utilize mathematical calculations and algorithms to create the illusion of depth and perspective, reminiscent of classic video games.
4. Interactive Gameplay: Craft an immersive gaming experience where players can move, rotate their view, and interact with the environment. Incorporate features like wall collisions, door interactions, and dynamic textures for added realism.

### Things to Do:
1. Implement Ray-Casting Algorithm: Develop the core ray-casting algorithm to render the 3D environment based on player perspective and map layout.
2. Map Verification: Create functions to verify the integrity of the map, ensuring it meets the required specifications and is suitable for gameplay.
3. 3D Rendering: Utilize mathematical calculations and graphics techniques to generate the illusion of three-dimensional space within the game world.
4. Interactive Controls: Implement intuitive controls for player movement, camera rotation, and interaction with objects in the environment.
5. Bonus Features: Explore additional features like collision detection, mini-maps, animated sprites, and interactive elements to enhance gameplay and immersion.

Embark on your journey into the world of retro gaming with Cub3D, where creativity meets technical prowess in the quest to recreate the magic of classic first-person shooters.
